The AI-Driven Research Assistant. 

This is an agentic AI application that conducts literature reviews, summarizes academic papers, suggests relevant sources based on user queries, and handles citations in formats like APA or MLA. MLA uses the author's last name and page number (e.g., Smith 25). APA uses the author's last name and the year of publication (e.g., Smith, 2023). MLA (Modern Language Association) and APA (American Psychological Association) are two widely used citation styles in academic writing. MLA is primarily used in the humanities, such as literature and language studies, while APA is commonly used in social sciences, psychology, and education.

Here we have used open-source tools and libraries.
